# Doctor Appointment Booking System — Backend

The Doctor Appointment Booking System is a secure and scalable backend built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.  
It enables patients to book appointments online, doctors to manage their schedules, and admins to oversee system operations through protected RESTful APIs.

## Backend Workflow Pipeline

Server Initialization → Environment Configuration → Database Connection → Authentication Middleware → Route Handling (User / Doctor / Admin) → Controller Logic → Response Handling

---

## System Architecture

Client → Express Server → Controller Logic → MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)  

Each request follows this structured flow:  
**Request** → **Authentication Middleware** → **Controller Logic** → **Database Operation** → **Response**
